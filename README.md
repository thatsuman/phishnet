# phishnet [WIP]

## An automated phishing attack detection using MLOps pipeline

### Problem Statement

Phishing attacks are sophisticated social engineering attempts designed to steal sensitive information like credentials, financial details, or personal data. These attacks often mimic legitimate websites or communications to deceive users.

How can we build a reliable, production-grade system to detect phishing attacks in network data using machine learning, with automatic data validation, model training, and deployment?

### How this project solves the problem?

This project appears to be a comprehensive MLOps pipeline designed to process network security data related to phishing attacks. The system follows a modular architecture with clearly defined stages for data processing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
